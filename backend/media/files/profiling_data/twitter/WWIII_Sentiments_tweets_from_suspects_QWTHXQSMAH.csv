Interest payments on student loan payments is tax deductible up to $2,500. Raise the amount that’s deductible, on par with mortgage debt. Lots of solutions if the goal were to solve a problem rather than print more money to buy off voters.",,,https://twitter.com/sjm1775/status/1520471895950381062

A new poll shows me down TWO points. Here's why this is concerning:

 I won my last race by 1,017 votes.
 If I lose, Democrats lose the Senate.
 The GOP has spent $7.8 million against me.
